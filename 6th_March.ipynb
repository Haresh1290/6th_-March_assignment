    "Statistical analysis and probability influence our lives on a daily basis. Statistics is used to predict the weather, restock retail shelves, estimate the condition of the economy, and much more. Used in a variety of professional fields, statistics has the power to derive valuable insights and solve complex problems in business, science, and society. Without hard science, decision making relies on emotions and gut reactions. Statistics and data override intuition, inform decisions, and minimize risk and uncertainty.\n",

    "#Problem_2\n",
    "Types of Statistics\n",
    "There are two kinds of Statistics, which are descriptive Statistics and inferential Statistics. In descriptive Statistics, the Data or Collection Data are described in a summarized way, whereas in inferential Statistics, we make use of it in order to explain the descriptive kind. Both of them are used on a large scale. Also, there is another kind of Statistics where descriptive transitions into inferential Statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is mainly divided into the following two categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "One of the types of statistics is descriptive statistics. It is used to quantitatively describe the attributes of the known data and provides summaries of either the sample or the population. Graphs, charts, and tables can be used to represent descriptive statistics. The measures of descriptive statistics are given as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of central tendency: These measures are used to describe data with respect to a single central point. Mean, median, and mode are three types of central tendency.\n",
    "Measures of dispersion: These measures are used to describe the variability of data. In other words, it is used to quantify the spread of a distribution about a central value. Range, variance, standard deviation, mean deviation, quartile deviation, and coefficients of dispersion are the types that fall under this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics\n",
    "Inferential statistics are used when generalizations about the population need to be made and conclusions need to be drawn based on the available samples. Inferential statistics uses various types of statistical tests and sampling techniques in order to make inferences about the population data. The measures of inferential statistics are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing - It is used to test some assumptions and make inferences about the population parameters by using an estimate of the sample. There are many types of statistical tests used for this purpose. Some of them are the z test, t test, f test, and ANOVA test.\n",
    "Regression Analysis - This type of analysis is used when the effect of change in one variable causing a change in another variable needs to be evaluated and quantified. Simple linear, multiple linear, nominal, logistic, and ordinal regression are the types of regression analysis.\n",
    "Before the various tools used in the different types of statistics can be deployed, it is necessary to also understand the types of data. The upcoming section will elaborate on the types of data and variables used in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Data in Statistics\n",
    "There are two types of data in statistics, namely, qualitative data and quantitative data. In data analysis, it is necessary to apply the correct testing technique which can only be done by sorting the data into various types. Given below are the different types of data in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative Data or Categorical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal data - This type of data can be divided into two mutually exclusive groups that do not overlap. Labels and tags are used to categorize such data. Nominal data does not have any intrinsic ordering and does not possess any numeric properly. Examples of nominal data are gender, eye color, etc.\n",
    "Ordinal data - Similar to nominal data, arithmetic, and logical operations cannot be performed on ordinal data as it does not possess any numerical property. However, such a type of data can be intrinsically ordered. For example, rating a restaurant experience on a scale of 1 - 5.\n",
    "Quantitative Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete data - This is one of the types of data that can only involve the use of integers and cannot be divided into smaller or finer parts. Mathematical operations can be performed on discrete data. For example, days of a month, number of teachers in a school, etc.\n",
    "Continuous data - Such a type of data can be divided into finer levels and can take on any numeric value. There are two types of continuous data, namely, interval and ratio data. Interval data can be negative and does not have a meaningful zero. On the other hand, ratio data can never be negative and has a meaningful zero. Calculations for continuous data are performed using descriptive statistics.\n",
    "Types of Variables in Statistics\n",
    "Just as there are two types of data, similarly, there are two types of variables in statistics. These variables are used to represent the corresponding data. In both types of statistics, it is necessary to choose the right kind of variable so as to administer the appropriate statistical test. Given below are the different types of variables in statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary or dichotomous variables - Such a type of variable can represent nominal data with only two levels of outcomes and does not possess any intrinsic ordering. For example, passing or failing in an examination.\n",
    "Nominal variables - Nominal variables are used to represent data that does not have any rank and cannot be ordered intrinsically. In other words, it is used to represent nominal data. For example, breeds of dogs.\n",
    "Ordinal variables - This type of variable is used to represent ordinal data wherein the groups can be ranked in a specific order. An example is the finishing rank of people in a race.\n",
    "Quantitative Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete variables - Discrete variables represent the counts of unique items or values. Such variables are also known as integer variables. The different types of flowers in a garden can be represented using discrete variables.\n",
    "Continuous variables - These variables, also known as ratio variables, are used to denote continuous data. It is used to represent non-finite and continuous values. For example, the volume of a sphere."

    "##Problem_3\n",
    "All quantitative data can be measured numerically, as shown above. But these data types can be broken down into more specific categories, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of quantitative data: discrete and continuous. Continuous data can be further divided into interval data and ratio data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete data\n",
    "In reference to quantitative data, discrete data is information that can only take certain fixed values. While discrete data doesn’t have to be represented by whole numbers, there are limitations to how it can be expressed. \n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLES OF DISCRETE DATA:\n",
    "The number of players on a team\n",
    "The number of employees at a company\n",
    "The number of items eggs broken when you drop the carton\n",
    "Shoe size\n",
    "The number of outs a hitter makes in a baseball game\n",
    "The number of right and wrong questions on a test\n",
    "A website's bounce rate (percentages can be no less than 0 or great than 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous data \n",
    "Continuous data, on the other hand, can take any value and varies over time. This type of data can be infinitely and meaningfully broken down into smaller and smaller parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLES OF CONTINUOUS DATA:\n",
    "Website traffic\n",
    "Water temperature\n",
    "Wind speed\n",
    "The time it takes to complete a task\n",
    "\n",
    "INTERVAL DATA\n",
    "Interval data is information that can be measured along a continuum, where there is equal, meaningful distance between each point on a scale. Interval data is always expressed in numbers where the distance between two points is standardized and equal. These numbers can also be called integers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of interval data include temperature, since it can move below and above 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "RATIO DATA\n",
    "Ratio data has all the properties of interval data, but unlike interval data, ratio data also has a true zero. For example, weight in grams is a type of ratio data because it is measured along a continuous scale with equal space between each value, and the scale starts at 0.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples of ratio data are weight, length, height, and concentration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Types of qualitative data (with examples)\n",
    "Qualitative data may be classified as nominal or ordinal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal data is used to label or categorize certain variables without giving them any type of quantitative value. For example, if you were collecting data about your target audience, you might want to know where they live. Are they based in the UK, the USA, Asia, or Australia? Each of these geographical classifications count as nominal data. Another simple example could be the use of labels like “blue,” “brown,” and “green” to describe eye color.\n",
    "Ordinal data is when the categories used to classify your qualitative data fall into a natural order or hierarchy. For example, if you wanted to explore customer satisfaction, you might ask each customer to select whether their experience with your product was “poor,” “satisfactory,” “good,” or “outstanding.” It’s clear that “outstanding” is better than “poor,” but there’s no way of measuring or quantifying the “distance” between the two categories.\n",
    "Nominal and ordinal data tends to come up within the context of conducting questionnaires and surveys. However, qualitative data is not just limited to labels and categories; it also includes unstructured data such as what people say in an interview, what they write in a product review, or what they post on social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some real-world examples of qualitative data?\n",
    "Some examples of qualitative data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Interview transcripts or audio recordings\n",
    "The text included in an email or social media post\n",
    "Product reviews and customer testimonials\n",
    "Observations and descriptions; e.g. “I noticed that the teacher was wearing a red jumper.”\n",
    "Labels and categories used in surveys and questionnaires, e.g. selecting whether you are satisfied, dissatisfied, or indifferent to a particular product or service."

    "The central tendency measure is defined as the number used to represent the center or middle of a set of data values. The three commonly used measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "A statistic that tells us how the data values are dispersed or spread out is called the measure of dispersion. A simple measure of dispersion is the range. The range is equivalent to the difference between the highest and least data values. Another measure of dispersion is the standard deviation, representing the expected difference (or deviation) among a data value and the mean.\n"
